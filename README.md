Notes: 
1. The Census-Data folder contains the Census Data from year 2000. 
This is useful if you are going to do analysis on zipcode level or to visualise your data on a geographical chart.

2. US postal code CSV file can be used if you want to map zipcode to state level or do some analysis on a higher level.
